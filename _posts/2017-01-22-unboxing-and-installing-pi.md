# In The Begining
I received a phone call from my girlfriend (soon to be wife) one day that she had left the keys in the house and couldn't get in. I groaned and left early from work. It was 20 degrees farenheit outside. Luckily, our neighbor was home and let her hang out while I made my way home.  When I came to get her we wondered why the heck we couldn't just open our garage door with our phones.  My girlfriend and I are software developers and our neighbor is a mechanical engineer--we should be able to figure this out!  So we decided to document our experience with this project.

In this blog post we'll document unboxing our Raspberry Pi and preparing it to be our home automation hub.

## What You'll Need

We recommend something formatted and preloaded with the NOOBS operating system to save some time.
* A 2.5A micro USB power cord and adapter
* An HDMI cable and monitor
* Mouse & Keyboard
* A wired network connection 

# The Hub
We decided that we would use the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CD5VC92/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01CD5VC92&linkCode=as2&tag=scrappyhomeau-20&linkId=cc81c3d2f83cc28b6fefe22ad022b9b2">Raspberry Pi 3</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=scrappyhomeau-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B01CD5VC92" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" > as the basis for our home automation.  The main reasons were the cost (who can beat $40 bucks) and the form factor.  This thing is tiny.  It has wi-fi built in as well so there is less wiring for the setup in general.
