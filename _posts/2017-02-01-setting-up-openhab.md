# Installing openHAB

## Goal
The goal for this post is to install openHAB 2.0 beta

## What you need
* A Raspberry Pi with Raspbian installed and ssh access

## What is openHAB
There is a fundamental problem with the current state of home automation--each *smart* device connects to their own cloud and their own smartphone app.  Enter openHAB, an open-source home automation hub with dozens of plug-ins. openHAB is written in java so it can run on any computer that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). openHAB, at the time of this post, is at version 2.0.
